    SPACE GAME ENGINE - WARP CORE
</h1>

## Description

This is a back-end only module of our easy-to-configure strategic game engine called "Warp Core". The focus of this module is on managing a single habitat within the game. With "Warp Core", you can manage your home world, build and upgrade buildings, develop new technologies, and create any units you want. Using just this module, you can create a functional single-player game centered on creating and managing your local economy, allowing you to grow as a single entity. However, if you wish to expand the gameplay and engage in multiplayer mode, you'll need to wait for the release of the additional modules that are currently in development.

The Warp Core API is a technology we use to make creating online games as easy as possible. It is built on top of GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs. Our goal is to create a tool that anyone can use, regardless of their level of experience. The API is designed to be simple to use, and queries can be explored through self-discovery. We provide documentation to help with custom integrations. Our aim is to make online game development accessible to everyone by leveraging the power of GraphQL and providing a user-friendly platform for developers.
